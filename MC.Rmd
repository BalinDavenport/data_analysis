## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r MC basic}
# Error in func1() : could not find function "func1"
# runs <- 100000
# func1 <- sum(sample(c(0,1), size = 10, replace = T)) >6
# mc_prob <- sum(replicate(runs, func1()))/runs
```

## Full Monte Carlo Sim in R 
* The winder can make 3000 – 5000 rolls per hour
* The bagger can make 2000 – 4000 rolls per hour
* The case packer can make 150 – 250 cases of 30 rolls each per hour
* The line will product at the slowest of the three
* Assume all distributions are uniform

```{r MC full}
results = NULL
for (k in 1:1000)
    {
     rolls = runif(1,3000,5000)
     bags = runif(1,2000,4000)
     cases = runif(1,150,200)*30
     total = min (rolls, bags, cases)
     results = rbind(results, data.frame(rolls, bags, cases, total))
    }
summary(results)
```

This produces a differnt number each time as it is taking the mean of a 
distribution the lower the first number the greater the differences will be.
```{r}
vecpoisson=rpois(1,5)
mean(vecpoisson)
```
A sum of exponentials produces a gamma distribution, using an apply() function
apply() functions behave similarly to for loops but are much quicker way of itterating
over an object.
Here we generate 5 samples from an exponential rate of parameter 0.1 and sum them
together. sum(rexp(n=nexps, rate=rate)) replicate allows us to do this many times
with very little code 50000 here to give us an idea of the distribution.

```{r}
reps <- 50000
nexps <- 5
rate <- 0.1
set.seed(0)
system.time(
    x1 <- replicate(reps, sum(rexp(n=nexps, rate=rate)))
) #replicate
head(x1)
```
To confirm a gamma distribution lets make a histogram or qqplot of the simulation

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(x1), aes(x1)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) +
    stat_function(fun=function(x)dgamma(x, shape = nexps, scale = 1/rate),
                 color = "red", size = 2)
```
```{r}
set.seed(0)
system.time(x1 <- lapply(1:reps, function(i){sum(rexp(n=nexps, rate = rate))})) # list apply
head(x1)
```
```{r}
set.seed(0)
system.time(x1 <- apply(matrix(rexp(n=nexps*reps, rate=rate), nrow=nexps),2,sum)) # apply on a matrix
head(x1)
```
```{r}
set.seed(0)
system.time(x1 <- colSums(matrix(rexp(n=nexps*reps, rate=rate), nrow=nexps))) # using colSums
```
```{r}
require(parallel)
set.seed(0)
system.time(x1 <- mclapply(1:reps, function(i){sum(rexp(n=nexps, rate=rate))})) # multi-cluster apply

```
